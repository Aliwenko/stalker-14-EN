To keep cooking in line with Stalker crafting, it uses the crafting station system.
There isn't really any reason to make it as complicated as Space Station cooking so the amount of viable ingredients
has been greatly reduced, and most things are crafted in one step at a cooking station.
(Though technically you can use anything as an ingredient, just make sure players can get it!)

If adding new recipes, make sure to add the recipe card item in Blueprints/cooking.yml,
the recipe code in Recipes/cooking.yml,
and the end result in Object/Consumable/Food/meals.yml or other relevant yml.

New ingredients go in Object/Consumable/Food/ingredients.yml or other relevant yml.

Most foods that would reasonably be in a bowl should have a bowl in the recipe, and return it as trash once eaten.

If you just want something to be cookable on a fire, refer to the meat.yml for examples of how it works.
