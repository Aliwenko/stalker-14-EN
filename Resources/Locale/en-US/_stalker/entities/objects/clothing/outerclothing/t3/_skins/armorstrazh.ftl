    .desc = Old, well-worn damask from the Monolith's arsenal, covered with traces of time and fierce battles. Despite his age, he is still a reliable shield that protects his wielder from the dangers of the Zone. The camouflage of the Seraphim gives it a unique appearance, and the numerous prayer signs and sacred amulets applied by a caring hand make it not just an armor, but a true talisman of faith and strength.
    .suffix = ST, T3, PVP
