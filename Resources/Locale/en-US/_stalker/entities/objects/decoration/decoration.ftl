ent-WoodenCrib = Baby Crib
    .desc = A vintage baby crib with side rails darkened by time and squeaky fittings. The headboard bears teeth marks and scratches — signs of early childhood and escape attempts.
    .suffix = ST, Mapping
ent-WoodenPiano = Piano
    .desc = A Soviet 'Belarus' brand piano with its distinct tone and straight body lines. The ivory keys are cracked in places, the pedals creak, but the soul of the instrument lives on in its deep bass and bright high notes.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-PhoneStalker = Landline Telephone
    .desc = A massive Soviet-era landline telephone with a coiled cord and a handset yellowed by time. Despite its appearance, the mechanism inside seems to work just fine. A symbol of an era when calls were rare and costly.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-WoodenBench2 = Wooden Bench
    .desc = A simple wooden bench with a surface worn to a shine. Years of use have rounded off its corners and given the wood a warm hue. Perfect for a tired traveler to rest on.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-RustySlide = Rusty Slide
    .desc = A brightly colored children's slide with worn sides from countless descents. The steps are worn smooth by thousands of tiny feet, and the plastic has faded in the sun — but the cheerful squeak when sliding down remains.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-HalfTire = Half Tire
    .desc = A half-decayed car tire, half-buried in the ground. The rubber is cracked and no longer elastic, filled with mud and last year's leaves. A silent witness to decades under the open sky.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-StackBooks = Stack of Books
    .desc = A tattered stack of books with yellowed pages and faded covers. Among them are Soviet textbooks, collections of literary classics, and a few popular science journals. Some spines are cracked from frequent reading, and the margins contain pencil notes from previous owners.
    .suffix = { ent-WoodenCrib.suffix }
ent-OldGen = Old Generator
    .desc = A massive diesel generator from the Soviet era, covered in chipped green paint and signs of repeated repair. Its bulky size and rugged design speak to its industrial past. Despite the rust and oil stains around the fuel tank, the inner mechanism seems capable of starting again with proper handling. Its low hum was once a common sound at many facilities where centralized power often failed.
