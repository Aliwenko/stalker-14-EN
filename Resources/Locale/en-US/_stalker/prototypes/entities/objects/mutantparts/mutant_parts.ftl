ent-BaseMutantPart = mutant part
    .suffix = Stalker, Part of the mutant
ent-MutantPartBlindDogTail = Blind Dog's Tail
    .desc = The resistance of the skin of mutated dogs to chemical and electrical stress has long attracted the attention of scientists. Due to the absence of fat deposits, dog tails are most suitable for laboratory research.
    .suffix = { ent-BaseMutantPart.suffix }
ent-MutantPartPseudodogTail = pseudodog's tail
    .desc = The resistance of the skin of mutated dogs to chemical and electrical stress has long attracted the attention of scientists. Due to the absence of fat deposits, dog tails are most suitable for laboratory research.
    .suffix = { ent-BaseMutantPart.suffix }
ent-MutantPartBoarHoof = hoof of a boar
    .desc = Boar's hoof is used by scientists to make a number of medicines, the most common of which is the anti-radiation serum used in scientific first aid kits.
    .suffix = { ent-BaseMutantPart.suffix }
ent-MutantPartFleshEye = Eye of Flesh
    .desc = After mutation, the enlarged eye of flesh acquired a number of properties, the most useful of which is the ability to regenerate the lens. The details of this mechanism are not known exactly, but this discovery promises to revolutionize medicine.
    .suffix = { ent-BaseMutantPart.suffix }
ent-MutantPartSnorkFoot = Snork Foot
    .desc = Snork's foot, unlike the human foot, contains a greater number of tendons that have amazing elasticity. These properties are of great interest to buyers and scientists.
