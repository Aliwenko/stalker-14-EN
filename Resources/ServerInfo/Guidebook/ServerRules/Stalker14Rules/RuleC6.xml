  # Core Rule 6 - Roleplay Standards

  Stalker 14 is an MRP server. You are expected to be a regular human being that fits in the lore of Stalker. You are not allowed to go running around naked acting like you have no sense.

  This rule applies less for Renegades and Monolith due to how mentally unstable they are but don't push your luck.

  Character quirks must be approved via administration. You cannot claim things to make major alterations to RP experiences. All characters when created are to act like a player would in the Stalker games.

  When in Rookie Village roleplay is heavily enforced, as new players join the server and this is the first area they see. Having their immersion broken or too much silliness going on will result in administrative action.

  Act your role. If you are a loner who just started your adventure, you are not allowed to talk about factions you haven't heard of or seen. More veteran players may share experiences they have had throughout the wipe. Roles like Ecologist, Military Stalkers, Clear Sky are able to have a better in-depth view on the zone, anomaly types, and artifacts. You should not go looking in the GitHub for the files and then going around in IC or LOOC talking about what does what or making some RP roles obsolete, not only kills RP but immersion for many.
