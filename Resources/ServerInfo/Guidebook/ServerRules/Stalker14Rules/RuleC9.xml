  # Core Rule 9 - PvP and PvE Rules

  This will be split into PVP and PVE. All rules from dying start from when you leave the latest safe zone (Green Zone, Faction Base). Losing your stuff is tough, especially for newer players, so these rules are split into two sections. If these rules are abused or used in bad faith, freezing in place upon seeing your corpse may be re-implimented. Bodies despawn after 40 minutes, leaving all gear on the ground.

  PVP:
  - You can remember where and how you died but not from who or what faction.
  - You can remember those you started traveling with but not those you met along the way should you die.
  - You can't start going to your dead body until 15 minutes have passed.
  - Dying to an anomaly or mutant during a PVP fight still counts as a PVP death.
  - You cannot hint or reveal you have died IC to others or where.
  - You cannot enter any safe zone within 5 minutes of PvP disengagement.

  PVE:
  - You can remember everything up until your death but not anything after that.
  - There is no time restriction on going back to your dead body.
