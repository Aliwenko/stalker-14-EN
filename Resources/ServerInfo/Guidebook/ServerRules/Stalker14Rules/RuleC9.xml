  # Core Rule 9 - Act like a human being

  Believe it or not, this is an MRP server. Now I'm not asking you to be like *Leans against the wall and lights a cigarette* but I expect you to be a regular human being
  that fits in the lore of Stalker. I don't want to see you running around naked acting like you have no sense. This rule applies less for Renegades due to how mentally unstable
  they are but don't push your luck.
