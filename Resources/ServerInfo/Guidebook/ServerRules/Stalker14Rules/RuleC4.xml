  # Core Rule 4 - Character Customization

  You're expected to commit to one character. Settings allow you to make alterations to your character, however you should not make drastic changes. You can change hairstyles, tattoos, and other marks but you shouldn't be becoming a whole different person.

  New characters or name changes should be approved by an administration before you commit to it.

  When making a character do not use famous or recognizable people as your character.
