  # Core Rule 1 - Don't be an asshole

  * Don’t be an asshole. At the end of the day, there’s a human being on the other side of the screen. Nothing said in-game should be a personal attack on the player. You can roleplay an asshole if it fits, but it shouldn’t carry over outside the game.

  * The rules can’t cover every possible situation. Administrators may step in to resolve issues not explicitly covered by the rules if needed. Administrators have the final say.

  * Do not lie in AHELPS, misunderstandings or misjudgment are bound to happen, however deliberately lying to administrators will only escalate things.

  * Don't try to exploit loopholes in the rules. The rules exist to keep the atmosphere enjoyable and the gameplay fun. We don't need people who degrade other players' gaming experience.
