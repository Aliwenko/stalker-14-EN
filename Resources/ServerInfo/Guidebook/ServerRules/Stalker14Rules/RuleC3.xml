  # Core Rule 3 - No metagaming or cheating

  Self-explanatory, I think. Don't use third-party tools or outside information your character wouldn't realistically know.
  This includes things like watching Stalker 14 EN streams while you're actively playing, no matter how fire it may be.

  Exploiting bugs for personal gain, like money duplication glitches, is strictly prohibited.
