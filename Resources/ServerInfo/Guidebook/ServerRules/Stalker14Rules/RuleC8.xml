  # Core Rule 8 - Do not RDM and Zone Rulings

  In most scenarios, you should not be shooting/attacking people as soon as you see them. However, there are zones where player versus player (PVP) is allowed. Robbing and looting should also not be your first go in general situations.

  PVP should not be done near transitions (Portals) to other regions. You should remain around at least .5 to 1 screen away from transitions to maintain fair playstyle. It can be hard to judge as some transitions are in tighter areas, so itâ€™s better to err on the side of caution. You may only PvP in these areas such as; someone has fled to the transition or has been sitting there for over 30 seconds.

  You should be at least three screens away from a green zone to initiate PVP or robbing. *Camping a transition or green zone will be punished severely.*

  [color=	#4169E1]Faction Bases:[/color] Faction base owners have the final say. They may use lethal force if the offender is violating their rules when appropriate or escalated. You may also have to comply with reasonable requests, ie: while in government facilities, you may be detained or lose access to the facility for breaking the law.
