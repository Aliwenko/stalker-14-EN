  # Core Rule 8 - Do not return to your place of death until 15 minutes have passed in PVP

  Boy oh boy, I love PVP. This will be split into PVP and PVE. All rules from dying start from when you leave the latest safe zone (Green Zone, Faction Base). I know losing
  your stuff sucks and there is a lot of noobies every day so I opted to split this into two different sections. If I feel people are abusing these rules I will have to re-implement
  the mechanic where you can't even approach your dead body. Bodies despawn after 40 minutes.

  PVP:
  - You can remember where and how you died but not from who or what faction.
  - You can remember those you started traveling with but not those you met along the way should you die.
  - You can't start going to your dead body until 15 minutes have passed.
  - Dying to an anomaly or mutant during a PVP fight still counts as a PVP death.

  PVE:
  - You can remember everything up until your death but not anything after that.
  - There is no time restriction on going back to your dead body.
