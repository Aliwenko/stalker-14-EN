  # Mercenaries

  The Mercenaries are the Zone’s hired guns; disciplined, efficient, and loyal only to the highest bidder. They’re a patchwork of ex–special forces, foreign operatives, and soldiers of fortune drawn to the Zone’s chaos for one thing: profit.

  To the Mercs, ideology means nothing. Duty, Freedom, the Military — all just clients or targets depending on the contract. Their allegiance shifts with the paycheck, and their silence is worth every ruble. They don’t fight for belief or territory — only money.

  Mercenaries complete contracts for a price of course! Mercenaries are allowed to PvP in yellow zones if they have a contract, HOWEVER; You must have a role-play engagement and the person who has the hit must be aware of what is about to happen. They must be able to respond or flee. This is aimed to keep fairness in mind. Mercenaries are not allowed to talk about the contracts or the client(s) to outsiders.
