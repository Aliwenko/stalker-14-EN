  # Duty

  Duty is the Zone’s shield, a disciplined paramilitary faction sworn to contain its horrors and prevent them from spreading beyond its borders. Formed from soldiers and veterans who witnessed the Zone’s devastation firsthand, Duty believes the Zone is a threat to humanity itself — one that must be controlled, contained, or destroyed.

  Duty sees themselves as the only line between civilization and chaos. To them, the Zone is not a playground for scavengers or a frontier for exploration — it’s a battlefield where humanity’s future is at stake.

  Yet, their rigid ideals often put them at odds with others. Freedom calls them tyrants. Bandits call them fools. But to Duty, it doesn’t matter who stands in their way — order must be restored, even if it means spilling stalker blood to do it.

  Deadly anomalies, dangerous mutants, anarchists and bandits... None will stop Duty on its triumphant march towards saving the planet! Duty aims to protect the innocent and destroy the zone. They do not use artifacts UNLESS in dire need. Duty may hunt for artifacts and sell them to Ecologist for a profit.

  Duty are allowed to use artifacts if their leader allows it.
