  # Freedom

  Freedom is the Zone’s rebellion. A loose collective of idealists and drifters who reject authority and believe the Zone belongs to everyone. To them, the Zone is not a threat to be contained, but a miracle to be understood and embraced. They fight for open access, freedom of movement, and the right for stalkers to live without the Military or Duty’s iron grip.

  They hold out in captured bases and ruined strongholds, living by their own code of independence and defiance. Though their lifestyle may seem chaotic, they’re far from amateurs. Freedom fighters are skilled, well-equipped, and fiercely loyal to their ideals.

  Their rivalry with Duty is legendary; ideology clashing with discipline, freedom against control. To outsiders, they’re reckless anarchists. To themselves, they’re liberators standing against oppression.

  Freedom has no specific rules regarding what they can / can't do- I guess you can say you're "free" to-do whatever, within the rules of course!
