  # Scientists

  The Ecologists are the Zone’s scholars: scientists, researchers, and government specialists sent to study its anomalies, fauna, and strange physics. Backed by state funding and international contracts, they represent the official scientific effort to understand the Zone’s mysteries… and possibly weaponize them.

  Ecologists rarely venture into danger themselves. Instead, they hire stalkers and or even at times mercenaries to collect data or recover artifacts. To them, every death, emission, and distortion is another data point, another piece of the puzzle.

  Though they claim neutrality, their alliances shift with necessity. To some stalkers, they’re a lifeline, paying well for dangerous work. To others, they’re meddlers tampering with things that should never be disturbed.

  Scientists should keep in mind how much power they have over the economy, you should not sell to every beggar who comes up trying to sell artifacts and mutant parts. This isn't explicitly a rule, just something to keep in mind. You should not be selling to or collaborating with anybody that you or the Military is at war with and doing so is grounds for in character punishment.

  Ecologist equipment is not to be sold to outsiders.

  Scientists should make a signed and stamped Field Scientist permit for every new one and post their name and photo in the database (Discord). This will help Military
  identify Field Scientists should they be stopped by them so they don't get their artifacts taken.

  * Wars and alliances subject to change, please refer to faction relations via the discord for up-to-date information. *

  Wars:
  - Bandits
  - Renegades

  Alliances:
  - Government (Military, Military Stalkers, Scientists, ETC)
