  # Scientists

  Scientists should keep in mind how much power they have over the economy, if possible, you should not sell to ever beggar who comes up trying to sell artifacts and mutant
  parts. However, this isn't explicitly a rule, just something to keep in mind. You should not be selling to anybody that you or the Military is at war with though, supplying the enemy and all that.
  While you are at war with these factions, you shouldn't be going out of your way to find them, but you can shoot them if you see them.

  Scientists should make a signed and stamped Field Scientist permit for every new one and post their name and photo in the database (Discord). This will help Military
  identify Field Scientists should they be stopped by them so they don't get their artifacts taken.

  Wars:
  - Bandits
  - Renegades

  Alliances:
