  # Clear Sky

  Clear Sky is the Zone’s secret conscience, a small, reclusive scientific faction dedicated to understanding the Zone rather than exploiting or destroying it. Born from former researchers, soldiers, and stalkers disillusioned by chaos, they seek balance: to coexist with the Zone while uncovering its true nature.

  Operating from hidden bases deep within the |REDACTED|, Clear Sky avoids open conflict unless provoked. Their technology is advanced, their intelligence unmatched, and their goal singular — to reveal how the Zone came to be, and why it continues to grow. They believe knowledge, not force, will bring control.

  Though their intentions are pure, their neutrality makes them vulnerable. To the Military, they’re an unauthorized research group. To the Bandits, they’re easy prey. To everyone else, they’re a mystery — one that’s often underestimated until it’s too late.
