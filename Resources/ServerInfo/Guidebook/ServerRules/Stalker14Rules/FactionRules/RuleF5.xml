  # Militia

  Militia are the first line of defense for Rookie Village. You should be protecting Loners from the tyranny of those who would hurt them. You are also allowed to remove
  any of the factions you are at war with from the Village. Should they refuse, you are allowed to start no more than a knife fight with them unless they begin to draw
  a gun, then it's fair game to shoot them.

  Wars:
  - Military
  - Military Stalkers
  - Bandits
  - Renegades
