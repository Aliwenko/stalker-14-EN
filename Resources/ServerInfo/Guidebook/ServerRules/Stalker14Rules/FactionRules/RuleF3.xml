  # Military

  The Military represents the last remnant of official order within the Zone. Disciplined, armed, and sworn to enforce government control over a place long beyond control. They patrol borders, secure checkpoints, and eliminate any stalker who dares trespass into restricted areas. To most, they’re not protectors- they’re occupiers.

  Soldiers of the Military operate with strict hierarchy and unwavering obedience to command. They see stalkers as criminals, smugglers, or potential threats to state security. Yet beneath the rigid discipline lies the same hunger that drives every soul in the Zone: money, survival, and the faint hope of understanding what truly lies at its center.

  Rumors persist of officers who trade favors, sell permits, or even collaborate with certain stalker groups but officially the Military denies any such corruption. To them, order must be maintained no matter the cost.

  The military are allowed to search people for illegal goods and confiscate them, namely artifacts and automatic weapons. However, people designated as Field Scientists are exempt from artifact confiscation. Check your database (Discord) for the list of Field Scientists or have them show a stamped and signed paper from a Scientist.

  A person with a weapons permit is exempt from automatic weapons confiscation. The military may also set up checkpoints to either search Stalkers or have them pay a bribe for passage.

  Stalkers that approach the Cordon Southern Checkpoint are allowed to be shot at.

  Military are allowed to hunt and use artifacts if their leader allows it.
