  # Core Rule 7 - Fear Roleplay

  * This rule is new and will be monitored for abuse or making certain metas *

  All stalkers have their limits, physically and mentally. When playing your character you must recognize immediate or impending danger- that said you should not be constantly putting your character in harm's way or ignoring it in an unrealistic way. You should not be going out naked with no gear when hunting other players or simply roaming. You know the zone is dangerous, act like it.

  Fights that you are outnumbered or overpowered in, such as a 1 to 2 or when the enemy is significantly more geared than you, you may retreat, hide, or fight back if fired upon. At times this cannot be adequately enforced, however if you have the knowledge of your opponent and go against this rule administrative action will be taken.

  Roles like; Monolith, Renegades, and Military Stalkers have more lee-way on this. Monoliths are brainwashed and feel no pain and never give up in a fight. Renegades are mentally unstable. Military Stalkers are special forces composed of veteran stalkers or specialized trained military.
