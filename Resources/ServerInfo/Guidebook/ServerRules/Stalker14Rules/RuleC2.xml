  # Core Rule 2 - No Exploiting or Cheating

  Under no circumstances are third-party tools or outside information your character wouldn't realistically know allowed to be used.

  No metacommunications or metagaming: this includes but is not limited to Stalker 14 EN streams, voice chats, out-of-character text communication, GitHub, or other sources while you're actively playing. Do not share current round information in the server's discord until it is  approved by administration or past at least 30 minutes.

  No Exploiting bugs or game mechanics: for personal gain such as money or item duplication, exploiting AI behaviors or structures, etc... is strictly prohibited.

  Sharing how to use bugs to other players is prohibited as well and will be treated as exploiting. You can only share bugs or issues to administration via AHELP or Discord in appropriate channels.
