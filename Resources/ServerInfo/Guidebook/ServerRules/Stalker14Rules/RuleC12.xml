  # Core Rule 12 - Alliances and Wars

  When factions come to a situation that will change faction relations there must be an administrator present or proof of role-play interaction. Administration will use this to see if it is grounds to approve or deny your request. You can message senior administrators in your faction’s channel.

  Senior Administrators; Host, Head Administrator(s) may ONLY make alterations to the faction relation's chart. Once approved, a senior administrator will give the leader of the faction access to the appropriate channel to do an official declaration of war or alliance in the discord and in-character.

  Some wars may or alliances MAY be done without roleplay if there has been substantial evidence to prove a reasonable cause, as long as senior administrators see fit.
