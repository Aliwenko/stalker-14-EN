  # Core Rule 10 - Robbing and Looting

  When engaging in interactions that involve robbing/kidnapping/searching another player you must clearly speak in English. You are allowed to use other languages to talk to others when in a casual setting, however, this is an English server. It is unfair to players who have no idea what you are asking or demanding.

  Being robbed is probably something you will run into quite often as Bandits and Renegades often patrol the zone, however, there are rules that they should follow. Factions will have different robbing rules that will be explained further in. These are rules that apply for all factions.

  Nobody should be robbing fresh across the border Loners. If they have a Stalker Jacket and a TOZ or they have one of the two starter kits, more likely than not they are brand new and robbing them is pointless and not fun for the guy getting robbed as he will actually end up with nothing. Instead, consider setting up checkpoints and charging entrance fees to garbage or protection money..

  When robbing a player if they actively try to resist or make it difficult (constantly breaking restraints, trying to run, overly verbally uncooperative) you may put them into a critical state, however you should meds to revive them once completely. If you have to revive more than twice you are allowed to kill them- in this case, AHELPing problem behavior is encouraged. This breaches rules for Role-play Standards, Fear Role-play, and Suicide when captured.

  No robbing or looting should be taking place in a [color=#008000]Green Zone[/color]. This includes those that are SSD. You are allowed to loot dead people outside of [color=#008000]Green Zones[/color] but you are not allowed to watch someone die and then proceed to loot them. Given the opportunity, you should attempt to rescue them unless the situation the dying person is in is way too dangerous for you to handle (EX. Heavily irradiated area or anomaly field with no protection, horde of dangerous mutants).

  Faction members catching a non-faction member wearing their gear is a reason to rob said individual. However, they should only be confiscating the faction's exclusive geararmor, unless they resist the attempt to have the gear confiscated- then anything is fair game. Factions are allowed to rob Renegades and Bandits if they are not allied with them and if they can confirm they are a member of those factions.

  Loners are allowed to rob people only outside of Cordon unless they are trying to be recruited by a bandit faction or accompanied by a bandit faction member.

  Anyone being robbed should AT LEAST be left with enough gear to reach a safe zone without dying to mutants on the way back.
