  # Core Rule 10 - You're going to die. A lot.

  Less so a rule, more like a fact. The Zone is very unpredictable, and I need you to understand that death is inevitable, and that's okay. You are going to lose stuff,
  it's part of the game. If you lose all your money, an admin can give you more money, just ahelp it. Remember, it's just a game. None of this is real. Wake up. I try to help
  people when they're about to die because I know losing stuff sucks but I can't help everytime, you'll have to accept the fact that you're probably gonna step on an anomaly
  and fucking die and that's okay.
