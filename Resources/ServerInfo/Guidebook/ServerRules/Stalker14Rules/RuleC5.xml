  # Core Rule 5 - IC in OOC

  Do not mention IC events in OOC that are current round. Such as, but not limited to; "I have died here, to so-and-so"

  Through out-of-character means like Discord or other means of communications, you cannot discuss any events outside of the main hubs such as Rookie Village or Bar as theyâ€™re occuring. As said before you may only talk about events AFTER 30 minutes have passed.

  Talks in discord or other platforms doesn't equal in-character interaction, UNLESS it is in your faction channel to communicate with your faction.

  Excessive harassment or insults to players for in-game issues or actions is prohibited.

  You may use LOOC to talk about game mechanics or hints, however again roleplay standards rule you may not just use it to give others information they wouldn't usually know.
