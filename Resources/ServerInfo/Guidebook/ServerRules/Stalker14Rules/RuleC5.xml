  # Core Rule 5 - Do not make new characters or change your name

  You're expected to commit to your character. Originally, the system only allowed you to save your character once, but that was relaxed to avoid constantly giving second chances for mistakes.
  You're free to change things like hairstyles, tattoos, or markings, but don't completely reinvent yourself. Creating new characters or changing your name requires admin approval before you proceed.

  You are not required to have a full name, you may use just a first name or nickname.
